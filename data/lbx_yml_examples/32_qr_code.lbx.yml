# 32_qr_code.lbx.yml
# Label with QR codes using different settings
# Note: For cell sizes, you can use:
# 1. Explicit point values: "0.8pt", "1.2pt", "1.6pt", "2pt", "2.4pt" (recommended)
# 2. Numeric indices (1-5):
#    - 1 = Small (0.8pt)
#    - 2 = Medium Small (1.2pt)
#    - 3 = Medium (1.6pt)
#    - 4 = Medium Large (2pt)
#    - 5 = Large (2.4pt)
# String aliases like "sm", "md", etc. are defined in the code but explicit point values
# or numeric indices are recommended for clarity and reliability.
