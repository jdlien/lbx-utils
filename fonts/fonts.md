# This folder contains fonts that are used in the P-touch Editor.

For license reasons, we cannot include the fonts in the repository, but they can be extracted from the P-touch Editor application bundle by running the `scripts/extract_fonts.sh` script from the root of the repository.

Example:

```bash
./scripts/extract_fonts.sh /Applications/P-touch\ Editor.app
```

This will create a `fonts` directory with the fonts inside.
